This project showcases a complete data engineering and analytics workflow using **Google Cloud Platform** and **Databricks**.  

### Main steps:
- **Cloud Setup**: Created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and shared project resources.  
- **Data Ingestion**: Downloaded dataset, uploaded to GCS, verified with Cloud Shell.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Imported data into BigQuery, executed multiple queries via Web Console and JupyterLab, exported results back to GCS.  
- **Data Analysis with Spark**: Loaded dataset into Spark DataFrames on Databricks, replicated queries using Spark SQL and DataFrame operators.  
- **Data Enrichment**: Applied a machine learning model with Spark MLlib.  
- **Data Visualization**: Built an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio (optional visualization in Databricks).  

The entire pipeline demonstrates the integration of cloud storage, distributed computing, machine learning, and visualization in a real-world data project.
